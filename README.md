# Testane
This project sums mmy first journey in learning Selenium, Python and overall QA Automation
Testane consists of a series of 10 small challenges.

The idea is to offer examples (good or bad) of simple tests to get you started into coding, Python and QA

### Stack:

- Python 3.8+
- Selenium 
- Chocolatey (for Windows users)

### Why is it there
When you get started on coding, you might need a simple challenge. What worked for me after many learning attemps is to use automation with Selenium and Python as a base to get my skills directly into action by solving simple issues and user interactions.

### How does it work
Simply install Python and Selenium, clone the repo and get into the adventure. It might not work pefectly in the first try, but thatÂ´s the idea, solve issues!

### Consider that that this is my first project
So do not expect that everything will be perfectly done.
